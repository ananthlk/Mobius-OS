# Mobius OS Sprint Log

## Sprint -1: "The Aesthetic Foundation"
**Status:** COMPLETED 🟢
**Date:** 2025-12-30

### 🏆 Celebration
Successfully established the "High-Trust / Minimalist" visual identity for Mobius OS across two major surfaces: the standard Web Portal and the Chrome Extension (Spectacles).

### 📝 Changelog
- **Design Language**: Established `Inter` font stack, clean white backgrounds, and the "Infinity Flow" gradient palette (Blue/Red/Yellow/Green).
- **Portal (`surfaces/portal`)**:
  - Replaced generic components with a custom, command-line inspired landing page.
  - Implemented the "Infinite Loop" SVG animation with seamless gradient transitions.
  - Added "Secure Channel" and HIPAA-compliant footer micro-copy to establish trust.
- **Spectacles (`surfaces/spectacles`)**:
  - Created a side-panel based Chrome Extension.
  - mirrored the Portal's high-trust aesthetic (shared color tokens, identical SVG logo).
  - Implemented a "Context-Aware" UI mockup that switches modes (Idle, Email, Web, Patient) to demonstrate intent.
