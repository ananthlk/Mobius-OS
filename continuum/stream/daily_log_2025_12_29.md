## The Foundation: Identity, Architecture, and The "Spectacles"

### 🌅 The Context
Before today, Mobius OS was a collection of loose scripts and ideas. The goal for Dec 29 was to establish the **"Aesthetic Foundation"** (Sprint -1) and break ground on the **"Functional Backbone"** (Sprint 1). We needed a visual identity that felt "High-Trust" and a deployment architecture that was "Zero-Toil."

### 🏗️ The Build: Core Architecture
We implemented the fundamental structure of the OS across two primary surfaces:

#### 1. The Portal (`surfaces/portal`)
*   **Tech Stack**: Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons.
*   **Visual Identity**: Implemented the "Infinity Flow" design system.
    *   **The Infinite Loop**: A custom SVG animation that serves as the loader and brand anchor.
    *   **Typography**: Standardized on `Inter` for clean, clinical readability.
    *   **Palette**: Established the "Nexus Light" theme (White/Gray-50 backgrounds with Blue-600 accents) to ensure a premium, medical-grade feel.
*   **Landing Page**: Built the "Command Line" inspired hero section, moving away from generic SaaS templates.

#### 2. Spectacles (`surfaces/spectacles`)
*   **The Pivot**: We decided to move the "Lens" functionality into a permanent Chrome Extension Side Panel.
*   **Implementation**: 
    *   Created `manifest.json` with `side_panel` permissions.
    *   Built the "Context-Aware" Router that switches UI based on the user's active tab (e.g., specific overlay for Gmail vs. generic web).
    *   Mirrored the Portal's design tokens to ensure brand consistency.

#### 3. The Nexus Backend (`nexus/`)
*   **API Separation**: Refactored the monolithic `app.py` into surface-specific routers:
    *   `modules/portal_endpoints.py`: Handles auth and dashboard data.
    *   `modules/spectacles_endpoints.py`: Handles context ingestion from the browser.
*   **Database**: Initialized the SQLite schema with `migrations/001_create_interactions.sql`.

### 🛡️ Infrastructure
We didn't want to deploy manually tomorrow, so we paid the "DevOps Tax" today.
*   **Docker**: Wrote optimized multi-stage `Dockerfile`s for both Nexus (Python/Slim) and Portal (Node/Alpine).
*   **GCP**: Configured `cloudbuild.yaml` to build and push images to Artifact Registry on every commit to `main`.
*   **Guide**: Documented the entire setup in `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`.

### ✅ End of Day Status
*   **Portal**: Localdev running on port 3000. Design system valid.
*   **Backend**: FastAPI serving health checks on port 8000.
*   **Spectacles**: Loads in Chrome as an unpacked extension.
*   **Blockers**: Authentication logic is stubbed but not connected to a real provider yet. That is the priority for tomorrow (Dec 30).
