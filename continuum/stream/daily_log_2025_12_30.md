# End of Day Log: December 30, 2025

## 🏆 The Big Wins
1.  **Hybrid Authentication & Failover**: 
    *   We successfully engineered a "Self-Healing" auth system for Vertex AI.
    *   It prioritizes AI Studio API Keys, but if they fail (401/Restricted), it transparently pivots to Google Cloud Project auth.
    *   *Result*: No more "Credentials Missing" crashes.

2.  **"Kitchen Sink" Model Discovery**:
    *   We stopped guessing which models actually work and just probed for *everything* (Gemini 3.0, 2.5, 2.0, 1.5).
    *   *Surprise Discovery*: `gemini-2.5-pro` and `gemini-2.5-flash` are active and usable in your region!

3.  **UX Stability**:
    *   Fixed the annoying "Card Collapse" bug where the UI would reset while you were working.
    *   Implemented "Live Verification" stamps (`Verified 12/30`) so you know exactly when a model was last tested.

4.  **Intelligent Workflow Engine (V1)**:
    *   Deployed `DiagnosisBrain` with heuristic scoring logic.
    *   Added persistent `ShapingChat` interface for clarifying user intent.

5.  **Infrastructure Automation**:
    *   Codified the GCP deployment path in `machinery/GCP_README.md`.

## 🤬 The Frustrations (and Fixes)
1.  **"Server Amnesia"**: 
    *   *Issue*: The server kept losing the ability to decrypt secrets after a restart.
    *   *Root Cause*: The `.env` file was buried in `nexus/` and wasn't loading consistently for scripts vs. server.
    *   *Fix*: Moved `.env` to the project root. Solved permanently.

2.  **Ghost Models (The "001" Problem)**:
    *   *Issue*: `gemini-1.5-flash-001` kept appearing as "Verified" even when it was broken (404).
    *   *Fix*: Implemented **Auto-Decommissioning**. If a model fails a ping, we strip its badge and mark it Inactive immediately.

## 🏗️ System Status
-   **Backend**: Python/FastAPI (Stable, Hybrid Auth Active)
-   **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (Stable, Non-collapsing Cards)
-   **Governance**: Strict (Broken models are auto-banned)
-   **Workflows**: Diagnosis Brain active (Heuristic Mode)

## 🔮 Next Steps
-   Start building workflows with the new Gemini 2.5 models!
