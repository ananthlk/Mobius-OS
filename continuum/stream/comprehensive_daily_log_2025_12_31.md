## The Workflow Sprint: Shaping, Context, and CRM

### 🌅 The Morning Context: From Gateway to Intelligence
We enter the last day of the year with a solid foundation.
*   **The Gateway** is robust (Hybrid Auth + 2.5-Series Discovery).
*   **The Foundation** is laid (`DiagnosisBrain` exists, but is naive).
*   **The Mission**: Today is about **Intelligence**. We need to make the `ShapingChat` actually *think*, not just echo. We need to implement the **CRM / Revenue Integrity** workflows to prove the system's value.

### 🏗️ The Build: (Lines of Code Pending)
Target modules for today:
*   `nexus/modules/shaping_manager.py`: Needs real LLM integration.
*   `nexus/recipes/crm_recipes.py`: Needs implementation.
*   `surfaces/portal/components/workflows/`: UI refinement.

### 🚀 Shift 1: (Pending)
