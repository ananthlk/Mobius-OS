## ☀️ The Morning Context
Starting the day with the **Intelligent Workflow Engine** as the primary directive.
Yesterday (Dec 30), we successfully deployed `DiagnosisBrain` (V0.9) and the persistent `ShapingChat`. The AI Gateway is stable (Hybrid Auth).
Today's goal is to move from "Heuristic Matching" to **"Deep Context Shaping"** and implement the first specialized CRM workflows.

## 🏗️ System Status
