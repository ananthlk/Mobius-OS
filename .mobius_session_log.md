# Mobius OS Development Session Log

This file captures our conversation during development sessions. 
The diary script will automatically include this in diary entries.

## How to Use

1. **Manual Entry**: Copy/paste conversation snippets here
2. **Auto-fetch**: The diary script will also try to fetch from database interactions table
3. **Environment Variable**: Set `MOBIUS_SESSION_LOG` with conversation text

## Current Session

USER: Let's create workflow scripts to manage our development process

ASSISTANT: I'll create scripts for:
- MobiusOSRun: Start dev environment
- MobiusOSGIT: Commit and push
- MobiusOSBuild: Production build
- MobiusOSDiary: Development diary with LLM prose

USER: The diary should be based on our session logs, how do we pass that to the llm to make sure it reflects our session our chats together?

ASSISTANT: I'll modify the diary script to:
1. Read from this session log file (.mobius_session_log.md)
2. Fetch from database interactions table if available
3. Accept conversation context via environment variable
4. Pass all this to the LLM so it can write about our actual collaboration
